In order to use the NCBI network services in conjunction with the Windows
Sockets (WinSock) development tools, it is necessary to copy the following
files into this directory:

  winsock.lib
  winsock.h

These files are widely available.  For example, they are currently (11/30/93)
available for anonymous FTP on sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/winsock-1.1.
