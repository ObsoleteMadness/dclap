// spup-updates.txt
// seqpup v 0.5a

fixed Save file in place -- now saves in proper folder, not in
seqpup folder

improved seqpup folder path finding 
		- MacOS: now should always find :tables:, :apps: if they exist
		  w/in SeqPup folder, and prefs paths are relative
		  (e.g., apps=apps, tables=tables  in .prefs)
	  - UnixOS: now can 'setenv SEQPUPHOME  /path/to/seqpup/folder'
	  - MSDOS : ditto with 'setenv SEQPUPHOME c:\path\to\seqpup'
	    NOTE: must use "APPNAME"HOME, so if you change name of SeqPup
	    to PeekUp, you need to change env var to PEEKUPHOME.
	    
added click-top-index-line to select sequence columns
  
added mask-to-selection, selection-to-mask commands -- mask-to-
  selection is not yet useful because base DTableView selection
  methods need to be rewritten to allow disjoint selections.
  
added seq-index display -- lists base number that mouse pointer is at

added mac file bundle rez & finder-open, finder-print 
   -- needs double check

added save of pretty print in PICT format (mac),
   metafile (mswin - still buggy?!)

added variable position grey coloring in align display

added mswin/xwin sticky menubar window
fixed mswin mouse-shift commands
added mswin menu command keys
fixed mac/mswin text edit command keys: cut/copy/paste

many updates to mswin version for micsoft win32/winnt/win95

updated fastdnaml app to version 1.1.1

added configurable child-app launch parameters
  -- dialogs in HTML.form format
  -- needs more work

added dna distance/similarity matrix function

added child apps: DeSoete's LSADT, Felsenstein's DrawTree & DrawGram

fixed bomb during cut/copy of pretty print view

fixed - cut/clear last seq in list, can't select new last seq (can see it)

fixed - scroll multi-align view w/ arrow when in Edit bases mode
        leads to overlapped draw of bases.

fixed - crash & failure when use Find w/ Edit bases mode 



in progress
------------

add network "child-apps" - e.g., call apps on remote (Unix)
computer w/ sequence inputs and get results returned, esp. w/ GCG and like
useful apps
  >> can do some of this; need persistence on client; bopper delete & other;
     problems w/ tcp failures; need to handle gcg graphics;
     
add disjoint selections to DTableView -- need for copy/paste among
  masks (using table selection as clipboard for masks)
  >> see seq selections when disjoint mask is front view -- not yet right
  
add/improve max. sequence length to be handled, from kilobases to megabases
  (target is 10MB sequences) -- ? use disk caching of seq. segments
	 >> can now open about 300KB up from about 30KB...


todo
-----------

fix child app results - repeated runs sometimes will reopen old output files!
 - unix: fastdnaml fails to return results after 1st run?
 
add undo for edit text in aln window

fix mswin edit align text 

fix mswin edits - mswin toolbox limiting to 255 chars !@

fix mswin rich text display (bombs on scroll of HELP doc !!)

fix seqprint - writeto text or pict (only pict now??)

add consensus for aminos (only for nucs now)

add sequence documentation options (user additions + save current
genbank/embl/etc docs)

improve seq mask operations and usage
  - annotate masks, choose which are used for pretty print, which for
    align view
  
debug mswin save tableview picture as win metafile format (?)


add other child apps - primer analysis, others ??

add user-configurable menus - read all menus from config file?

add dialogs for configuring child-apps? (current html.form is now
  a widespread syntax).
  
add variable color display in alignment window, as aids to aligning:
  done/1. color change as alignment improves/worsens  
  2. mask colors (e.g., stem & loop areas for RNA)
  
add color picker dialog for color tables

add editable data table interface

add name window pane resizer

fix DAlnEditCommand to handle cut/copy/paste of selected block within
    alignview (now only does full rows, selected alnindex)

add/create new main app for base calling from API/other traces, and
sequence assembly? - use autoseq.C (Reece Hart	(reece@ibc.wustl.edu)) 
as ? extern-app or build into program? -- want to display traces +
called bases and allow user to edit bases...

add ORF maps, R.E. Maps, other items for sequence assembly validation?

add seq Annotation/Feature handling (part of seq documentaion handling), and
highlighting of bases by features.

add basic HTTP/HTML forms processing for simple cli/server dialogs
-- will want to hand off most result html docs to alt. viewer

add user-configurable menus - read all menus from config file?
add user-configurable dialogs - convert most to html forms?
