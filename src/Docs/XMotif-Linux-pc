Motif is a commercial product! You have to buy it!


  I didn't have the chance yet to evaluate it. Bernhard
  Strassl is working on a version that can be used with
  Metrolinks Motif on Linux.

** TAMU Linux Distribution
   Last modified 31 Oct 93
   Availability: The latest TAMU release is available by anonymous ftp
        from net.tamu.edu:pub/linux.

** SlackWare Linux v1.1.0
   Last modified 5 Nov 93

        The SlackWare release of Linux is the *only* release officially
        recommended by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

        Distributor: Patrick Volkerding <volkerdi@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu>

        Description: Slackware Linux is a full featured distribution of the
        Linux operating system designed for 386/486 computers with a 3.5"
        floppy. Slackware changes rapidly, but here's a current (partial)
        feature list:

        A series (14 disks): Base Linux 0.99pl13 OS and utilities.
          Networking, UUCP, gcc/g++ 2.4.5, libc 4.4.4, and more.
        E series (5 disks): Emacs 19.19.
        F series (1 disk): FAQs, HOWTOs, and other documentation.
        OI series (3 disks): ObjectBuilder 2.0 for X.
        X series (5 disks): Base XFree86 2.0 X windows system with fvwm.
        XAP series (2 disks): X windows applications such as seyon and
          ghostview.
        XD series (3 disks): X windows program/server development.
        XV series (2 disks): XView 3.2 release 5, Open Look Window Manager.
        Y series (1 disk): Games from BSD, such as "hunt".

        Availability: The home site is ftp.cdrom.com, where the latest
        distribution can be found in /pub/linux/slackware. To make it easy
        to download, the disks can also be found pre-zooed in
        /pub/linux/zooed_slackware. (Zoo is just a compression utility for
        MS-DOS).

        Ordering: FTP only, although various independent distributors provide
        it on disk, floppy, and CD.
