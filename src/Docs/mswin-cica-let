Do you know of an MS-Windows computer that might be loaned to me
for a week or two, for software development?  I would also need
either Borland's or Microsoft's C/C++ compiler for Windows on it.

If I can get my hands on such a machine then I can test and make
available a multi-platform C++ application development library (Mac,
X-Window/Motif and MS-Windows).  I've been working on this over
the holidays, and have it going on Mac and Motif, but lack
an MS Windows machine.

I'm going to make this software source freely available to IU 
and the public in general.  It may be of interest to your/other
groups at IU.  You can see a demo application written on this 
application library: ftp to ftp.bio.indiana.edu, folder 
/util/dclap/preview.  

I'm most interested in getting hands on an mswin computer this 
month, the sooner the better, as I'm running out of time I can
spend on development (until next vacation).

Thanks,  Don


						------ a summary --------

My holiday gift to the world is a bit delayed, but here is a peek
at it:
  a C++ application library, built on NCBI's Vibrant and core
  toolkit, for software developers.  Don's Class Application library
  (DCLAP) will let me, and others if they want, write applications
  in a relatively easy way, using this oop application library.
  The applications will compile and run on any platforms that NCBI's
  Vibrant toolkit supports, that currently being Macintosh, MS-Windows
  and Motif-XWindows.

MyApp-sparc-motif was compiled on my Sun Sparcstation, using a Motif
library.  It requires, I believe, the shared motif run-time libraries
on your Sparc system to work.

MyApp.hqx was compiled for Macintoshes.

I don't have an MS-Windows system (yet), so can't provide
that version.

The source for this C++ library will be made available free to the
public -- but it still needs much work.

This tidbit is at ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/dclap/preview


This is built on the cross-platform toolkit from National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of the National Library of Medicine (
NLM), called NCBI toolkit, and especially the Vibrant window system
subset, plus the coretools subset.  This toolkit is written in ANSI C,
and compiles on a variety of systems.  The source for NCBI tools is
available for anonymous ftp from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as 	
	cd toolbox\ncbi_tools
	bin
	get ncbi.tar.Z
	quit
This has much more than the subset with DCLAP, including detailed
documentation. Most of the additional source is directed toward
manipulation biosequence data. 

The NCBI toolkit compiles & runs on following platforms.  DCLAP has
been tested so far on Mac (think c 6/sym c++) and Sun-Sparc w/ Motif.

MS-DOS/MS-WIN
     Microsoft C version 7.00
     Microsoft Windows version 7.00
     Borland C++ 3.1
     Borland C++ 3.1 for Windows
Mac
	NCBI toolkit tested on THINK C 5.0.4 and MPW C 3.2
Unix
    NCBI toolkit tested on Sun Sparc, Silicon Graphics, IBM 3090 with AIX
	with X-Motif
VMS w/ Motif
