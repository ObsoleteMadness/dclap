This version of SeqPup is compiled for Sun Solaris 2 on a SPARC cpu.
It requires a system that include Motif XWindow libraries, which
come as part of Solaris 2.4 (in /usr/dt/lib), but are not standard
parts of earlier Solaris.   If you do have motif, you may still need
to tell the system where it is, with a statement like this:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/dt/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib
