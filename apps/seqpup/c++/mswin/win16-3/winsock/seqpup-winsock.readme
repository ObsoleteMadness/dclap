If you use MSWindows 3 and do NOT have a network connection to it,
you may well need to add a winsock.dll to the c:\windows\ folder
in order to allow SeqPup to run on your system.

Use this *only* if SeqPup fails to run on your Windows 3 system,
with a message something like 
"Cannot find file or one or one of it's components..."

FTP the winsock.dll here using Binary ftp. This winsock.dll is from the 
winsock.zip, which is the Trumpet version.

Put winsock.dll file in your c:\windows\ folder.  It may not be
functional w/ SeqPup, but seqpup should then start up.
