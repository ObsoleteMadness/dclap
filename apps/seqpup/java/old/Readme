This is the SeqPup biosequence editor distribution archive,
iubio.bio.indiana.edu/molbio/java/apps/seqpup/

You don't need everything in this folder.  Start with one
of the items in the full-package/ folder, depending on your
computer operating system.  Updates to the full package may be
placed in the other folders.  Using the Update option of the
program or checking file dates will tell you which items may
need updating.

NOTE on Wintel version (sep98) - you need the "JDK" version of java,
not the "JRE" version, to use the current seqpup. This will
later be fixed to use jre also.
