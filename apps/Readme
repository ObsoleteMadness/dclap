This folder contains applications written with the DCLAP
C++ class application framework.  This cross-platform
framework allows the same program to be compiled for Macintosh,
MS Windows, X-Windows-Motif and possibly others.

In general, you want to fetch the binary archive files for
any computer systems of interest to you PLUS any accessory
documents, like help files, example data, which are not necessarily
included with the binary archive file.

Binaries for Macintosh generally have the suffix -mac.hqx (for standard
mac binhex archive).

Binaries for MS Windows generally have the suffix -mswin.zip, for
standard ZIP archive.

Binaries for XWindows will have some name relating the unix flavor.
These may include
   -sun-static.Z   -- a compressed binary for Sun Sparcstation with
      SunOS 4.x, using static library linking to include Motif libs
      (won't run on Solaris 2)
   -sun-dyn.Z  -- compress binary for Sun Sparcstation.  Should run
      on SunOS 4 and Solaris 2, but your system must include Motif libs.
   -sgi.Z  -- compressed binary for Silicon Graphics MIPS/Irix platforms.

Those who build binaries for other systems, please consider dropping off
here for others.
